      <h6>MY EDUCATION JOURNEY</h6>
      <p>
I started my educational journey in Karapul Primary school, after wards I journed Ulanda girls and currently at Zetech University 
      </p>

    <p>
      My educational journey began in the quaint classrooms of Karapul Primary School, where I eagerly absorbed the foundational knowledge that would shape my academic path. Surrounded by supportive teachers and enthusiastic peers, I discovered the joy of learning and the power of education to ignite curiosity and fuel ambition.
     </p>
      
     <p>   
With a thirst for knowledge ignited, I embarked on the next chapter of my journey at Ulanda Girls High School, where I delved deeper into my studies and honed my skills in various subjects. Amidst the bustling halls and vibrant campus life, I embraced new challenges, forged lasting friendships, and cultivated a passion for academic excellence.
     </p>   

     <p>   
Now, as I continue my educational journey at Zetech University, I am excited to further expand my horizons and pursue my academic and professional aspirations. Surrounded by a diverse community of learners and guided by experienced mentors, I am empowered to explore my interests, develop new skills, and contribute meaningfully to society.
    </p>   

   <p>   
Through each chapter of my educational journey, from Karapul Primary School to Ulanda Girls High School and now to Zetech University, I am grateful for the opportunities to learn, grow, and thrive. With determination, perseverance, and a thirst for knowledge, I am excited to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, confident in my ability to make a positive impact and achieve my goals.
